## Disk Partitioning Strategy

### Partition Layout (Percentage-Based)

This guide uses percentage-based partitioning to accommodate various disk sizes. The following table provides a recommended partition layout:

| Partition | Percentage | Type | Filesystem | Mount Point | Purpose | Encrypted |
|-----------|------------|------|------------|-------------|---------|-----------|
| `/dev/sdX1` or `/dev/nvme0n1p1` | 0.2% (min 512 MB) | EFI System | FAT32 | `/boot` | UEFI bootloader (GRUB) | **No** |
| `/dev/sdX2` or `/dev/nvme0n1p2` | 70% | Linux filesystem | Btrfs | `/` | Arch Linux root (encrypted) | **Yes (LUKS2)** |
| `/dev/sdX3` or `/dev/nvme0n1p3` | 3-5% | Linux swap | swap | `[SWAP]` | Encrypted swap partition | **Yes (LUKS2)** |
| Remaining space | ~25-27% | - | - | - | Optional: Windows, data, or unallocated | - |

**Note:** For dual-boot scenarios, adjust percentages accordingly. For example:
- Windows partition: 50-60%
- Arch Linux root: 30-35%
- Swap: 3-5%
- EFI: 0.2% (minimum 512 MB)

### Encryption Details

- **Algorithm**: AES-XTS-PLAIN64
- **Key size**: 512-bit (maximum security)
- **Key derivation**: Argon2id (LUKS2 default, memory-hard)
- **Boot partition**: **Unencrypted** (required for UEFI)
- **Root partition**: **Encrypted** (LUKS2)
- **Swap partition**: **Encrypted** (LUKS2)

### Btrfs Subvolume Organization

```
@ (root)           - System files (/bin, /etc, /opt, /usr, /var)
@home              - User home directories (/home)
@log               - System logs (/var/log)
@cache             - Package cache (/var/cache)
@snapshots         - Snapshot storage (/.snapshots)
```

**Why This Layout?**
- Separate subvolumes allow independent snapshots
- `@log` and `@cache` excluded from snapshots (saves space)
- `@home` included in snapshots (preserves user data + system state)
- Enables instant system rollback via snapshot tools

## Phase 2: Disk Partitioning

**TIME:** Estimated Time: 5-10 minutes  
**NEXT:** Restart Count: 0

**WARNING:** CRITICAL WARNING: Double-check every command before pressing Enter

### Step 2.1: Identify Disk Device

```bash
# List all block devices and partitions
lsblk

# Example output:
# NAME        MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
# sda         8:0      0 500.0G  0 disk
# or
# nvme0n1     259:0    0 500.0G  0 disk

# Identify your target disk (usually the largest one, NOT the USB drive)
# USB drives are typically smaller (8-32 GB)
```

**Note your disk device name** (e.g., `/dev/sda` or `/dev/nvme0n1`)

### Step 2.2: Launch cfdisk Partition Editor

```bash
# Open cfdisk for your disk (replace /dev/sdX with your actual device)
cfdisk /dev/sdX

# For NVMe drives:
cfdisk /dev/nvme0n1

# Partition table type should be: gpt
# If asked "Select label type", choose: gpt
```

**cfdisk Text UI appears with partition table**

### Step 2.3: Navigate cfdisk Interface

**cfdisk Keyboard Controls:**
- **↑ ↓ Arrow Keys**: Select partition
- **← → Arrow Keys**: Select menu option (New, Delete, Type, Write, Quit)

```

**SUCCESS:** Phase 2 Complete: Disk partitioned successfully

**NEXT:** Next: Encrypt Linux partitions with LUKS2 (Phase 2)

---

## Phase 2: LUKS2 Encryption Setup

**TIME:** Estimated Time: 10-15 minutes  
**NEXT:** Restart Count: 0

### 4.1 Theoretical Foundation of Disk Encryption

#### 4.1.1 Introduction to LUKS

The Linux Unified Key Setup (LUKS) specification, first introduced in 2005, establishes a standardized format for encrypted disk partitions on Linux systems [1]. LUKS addresses the fundamental challenge of transparent disk encryption: providing strong cryptographic protection while maintaining compatibility across different Linux distributions and tools.

The LUKS specification defines a header structure that contains all necessary metadata for encryption, including cipher specifications, key derivation parameters, and key slot information. This header-based approach enables interoperability—a LUKS-encrypted partition created on one distribution can be decrypted on another, provided the necessary tools are available.

#### 4.1.2 LUKS2 Architecture and Design Principles

LUKS2, introduced in 2016 as part of cryptsetup 2.0.0, represents a significant evolution from LUKS1. The design addresses several limitations of the original specification while maintaining backward compatibility where possible.

**Key Architectural Improvements:**

1. **Multiple Key Slots**: LUKS2 supports up to 32 key slots (compared to 8 in LUKS1), enabling more flexible key management strategies. Each key slot can contain either a passphrase-derived key or a keyfile-derived key, allowing for multiple authentication methods on a single encrypted volume.

2. **Modern Key Derivation Functions**: LUKS2 adopts Argon2id as the default Password-Based Key Derivation Function (PBKDF), replacing the PBKDF2 algorithm used in LUKS1. Argon2, the winner of the Password Hashing Competition (2015), provides superior resistance to both time-memory trade-off attacks and side-channel attacks [2].

3. **Metadata Integrity Protection**: LUKS2 includes integrity protection for metadata structures, preventing tampering with encryption headers. This is achieved through cryptographic checksums embedded in the header structure.

4. **Per-Segment Encryption**: LUKS2 supports segment-based encryption, allowing different encryption parameters for different regions of the disk. This enables optimization for specific use cases, such as using different ciphers for different data types.

5. **Active Development**: LUKS2 is actively maintained and receives new features, while LUKS1 is in maintenance mode with only security updates.

#### 4.1.3 Cryptographic Primitives and Algorithm Selection

**AES-XTS-PLAIN64 Cipher Mode:**

The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in XTS (XEX-based Tweaked CodeBook mode with Ciphertext Stealing) mode represents the current best practice for disk encryption [3]. The selection of this specific cipher mode is based on several critical factors:

**XTS Mode Characteristics:**
- **Random Access Optimization**: Unlike block cipher modes designed for sequential data (such as CBC), XTS is specifically optimized for random access patterns typical in filesystem operations. Each disk sector can be encrypted and decrypted independently without requiring access to previous sectors.

- **Tweakable Encryption**: XTS uses a "tweak" value derived from the sector number, ensuring that identical plaintext blocks at different sector positions produce different ciphertext. This prevents pattern analysis attacks that could reveal information about disk contents.

- **Performance**: XTS mode is highly parallelizable and benefits significantly from hardware acceleration (AES-NI instructions available in modern CPUs). The mode's design allows for efficient implementation in both software and hardware.

**Key Size Selection (512-bit):**

The 512-bit key size in XTS mode actually consists of two independent 256-bit AES keys. This configuration provides:
- **Maximum Security**: 256-bit keys provide security equivalent to 2^256 operations, which is computationally infeasible to brute-force with current and foreseeable technology.
- **Hardware Compatibility**: 256-bit keys are fully supported by AES-NI instructions in modern Intel and AMD processors, ensuring optimal performance.
- **Standard Compliance**: The 512-bit XTS configuration aligns with NIST recommendations for disk encryption [4].

**PLAIN64 Sector Addressing:**

The "PLAIN64" designation refers to 64-bit sector addressing, which enables encryption of disks larger than 2TB. This is essential for modern storage devices, including NVMe SSDs.

#### 4.1.4 Key Derivation: Argon2id Analysis

**Password-Based Key Derivation Function (PBKDF) Requirements:**

The transformation of a human-memorizable passphrase into a cryptographic key suitable for encryption requires a key derivation function that addresses several security challenges:

1. **Dictionary Attack Resistance**: Simple passphrases must be protected against brute-force attacks using common password dictionaries.
2. **Time-Memory Trade-off Resistance**: The function should resist attacks that precompute hashes (rainbow tables).
3. **Parallelization Resistance**: The function should be difficult to parallelize, preventing GPU-based attacks.
4. **Side-Channel Attack Resistance**: The function should not leak information through timing or power consumption patterns.

**Argon2id Algorithm:**

Argon2id, the hybrid variant of the Argon2 family, combines the security properties of Argon2i (resistant to side-channel attacks) and Argon2d (resistant to GPU attacks) [2]. The algorithm's design includes:

- **Memory-Hard Function**: Argon2id requires a configurable amount of memory (typically 64MB-1GB) during computation, making GPU-based attacks impractical due to memory limitations of graphics processors.

- **Time Cost Parameter**: The algorithm includes a time cost parameter that determines the number of iterations, allowing adjustment of the computational cost to balance security and usability.

- **Adaptive Security**: The memory and time parameters can be adjusted based on threat model and hardware capabilities, providing flexibility for different deployment scenarios.

**Iteration Time Selection (5000ms):**

The `--iter-time 5000` parameter specifies that key derivation should take approximately 5 seconds. This duration represents a balance between:
- **Security**: Longer derivation times increase resistance to brute-force attacks.
- **Usability**: Excessive derivation times (beyond 10-15 seconds) become impractical for regular use.
- **Hardware Considerations**: The actual time depends on CPU performance; 5 seconds provides adequate security on modern hardware while remaining acceptable for user experience.

## Phase 2: Btrfs Filesystem Creation

**TIME:** Estimated Time: 5-10 minutes  
**NEXT:** Restart Count: 0

### 5.1 Theoretical Foundation of Copy-on-Write Filesystems

#### 5.1.1 Introduction to Btrfs

Btrfs (B-tree filesystem) is a modern copy-on-write (CoW) filesystem developed for Linux, first merged into the mainline kernel in 2009. The filesystem was designed to address fundamental limitations of traditional filesystems (ext4, XFS) while providing advanced features such as built-in snapshots, checksums, and compression [5].

The B-tree data structure, from which Btrfs derives its name, provides efficient indexing and enables the filesystem to scale to very large sizes (up to 16 exbibytes) while maintaining consistent performance characteristics. Btrfs represents a paradigm shift from traditional in-place modification filesystems to a copy-on-write architecture that fundamentally changes how data integrity and system recovery are achieved.

#### 5.1.2 Copy-on-Write Architecture: Principles and Implementation

**Traditional In-Place Modification:**

Conventional filesystems (ext4, XFS) employ in-place modification: when a file is updated, the filesystem directly overwrites the existing data blocks. This approach has several critical limitations:

1. **Atomicity Challenges**: If a write operation is interrupted (power loss, system crash), the filesystem may be left in an inconsistent state, requiring filesystem check (fsck) operations that can take significant time on large filesystems.

2. **Snapshot Complexity**: Creating snapshots requires copying all data blocks, which is both time-consuming and space-intensive. This limitation typically requires external tools (LVM snapshots) that add complexity and overhead.

3. **Data Integrity**: Without checksums, silent data corruption (bit rot) can occur undetected, potentially leading to data loss.

**Copy-on-Write Mechanism:**

Btrfs implements a copy-on-write architecture where modifications are never performed in-place. Instead:

1. **New Block Allocation**: When a file is modified, Btrfs allocates new blocks for the changed data rather than overwriting existing blocks.

2. **Pointer Updates**: After successful write, Btrfs updates metadata pointers to reference the new blocks.

3. **Old Data Preservation**: The original data blocks remain intact until they are no longer referenced (either by the current filesystem state or by snapshots).

This mechanism ensures that the filesystem can always revert to a previous consistent state, as the original blocks remain available until explicitly freed.

#### 5.1.3 Snapshot Mechanism and Space Efficiency

**Snapshot Creation:**

Btrfs snapshots are implemented through reference counting and shared block allocation. When a snapshot is created:

1. **Instant Creation**: The snapshot creation is effectively instantaneous (typically < 1 second) regardless of filesystem size, as it only involves creating new metadata structures that reference existing data blocks.

2. **Shared Blocks**: The snapshot and the original filesystem share all data blocks initially. Only when a block is modified in either the original or the snapshot does Btrfs allocate a new block (copy-on-write).

3. **Space Efficiency**: The space overhead of a snapshot is proportional to the amount of data that differs between the snapshot and the current state, not the total filesystem size.

### Step 2.1: Format Root Partition with Btrfs

```bash
# Create Btrfs filesystem on encrypted root
mkfs.btrfs -L "Arch Linux" /dev/mapper/cryptroot

# -L "Arch Linux" = Human-readable label
```

**Output:**
```
btrfs-progs v6.x.x
Label:              Arch Linux
UUID:               XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
Node size:          16384
Sector size:        4096
...
```

**Completion time:** 5-10 seconds

### Step 2.2: Mount Btrfs Root Temporarily

```bash
# Mount encrypted Btrfs partition to /mnt
mount /dev/mapper/cryptroot /mnt
```

### Step 2.3: Create Btrfs Subvolumes

**WARNING:** Subvolume names MUST match exactly (@ symbol is critical)

```bash
# Create @ subvolume (root filesystem)
btrfs subvolume create /mnt/@

# Create @home subvolume (user home directories)
btrfs subvolume create /mnt/@home

# Create @log subvolume (system logs)
btrfs subvolume create /mnt/@log

# Create @cache subvolume (package cache)
btrfs subvolume create /mnt/@cache

# Create @snapshots subvolume (snapshot storage)
btrfs subvolume create /mnt/@snapshots
```

**Each command should output:**
```
Create subvolume '/mnt/@'
Create subvolume '/mnt/@home'
...
```

### Step 2.4: Verify Subvolumes Were Created

```bash
# List all Btrfs subvolumes
btrfs subvolume list /mnt

# Should show:
# ID 256 gen X top level 5 path @
# ID 257 gen X top level 5 path @home
# ID 258 gen X top level 5 path @log
# ID 259 gen X top level 5 path @cache
# ID 260 gen X top level 5 path @snapshots
```

**SUCCESS:** All 5 subvolumes created successfully

### Step 2.5: Unmount and Remount with Subvolumes

```bash
# Unmount root
umount /mnt

# Mount @ subvolume as root with compression
mount -o subvol=@,compress=zstd,noatime /dev/mapper/cryptroot /mnt
```

**Mount options explained:**
- `subvol=@` - Mount specific Btrfs subvolume
- `compress=zstd` - Enable Zstandard compression (transparent, fast, ~20-30% space savings)
- `noatime` - Don't update file access time (improves performance, reduces SSD wear)

### Step 2.6: Create Mount Point Directories

```bash
# Create directories for mount points
mkdir -p /mnt/{home,var/log,var/cache,boot,.snapshots}
```

### Step 2.7: Mount All Btrfs Subvolumes

```bash
# Mount @home subvolume
mount -o subvol=@home,compress=zstd,noatime /dev/mapper/cryptroot /mnt/home

# Mount @log subvolume
mount -o subvol=@log,compress=zstd,noatime /dev/mapper/cryptroot /mnt/var/log

# Mount @cache subvolume
mount -o subvol=@cache,compress=zstd,noatime /dev/mapper/cryptroot /mnt/var/cache

# Mount @snapshots subvolume
mount -o subvol=@snapshots,compress=zstd,noatime /dev/mapper/cryptroot /mnt/.snapshots
```

### Step 2.8: Mount EFI Boot Partition

```bash
# Mount EFI partition
mount /dev/sdX1 /mnt/boot

# Replace /dev/sdX1 with your actual EFI partition
```

**WARNING:** This partition is SHARED between Windows and Linux bootloaders (if dual-booting)

### Step 2.9: Format and Enable Swap

```bash
# Create swap filesystem on encrypted swap partition
mkswap /dev/mapper/cryptswap

# Output:
# Setting up swapspace version 1, size = X GiB
# no label, UUID=XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX

# Enable swap
swapon /dev/mapper/cryptswap
```

### Step 2.10: Verify All Mounts

```bash
# Check complete mount hierarchy
lsblk -f

# Should show:
# sdX
# ├─sdX1
# │ vfat        FAT32                                    /mnt/boot
# ├─sdX2
# │ crypto_LUKS 2
# │ └─cryptroot
# │   btrfs           Arch Linux                         /mnt/.snapshots
# │                                                       /mnt/var/cache
# │                                                       /mnt/var/log
# │                                                       /mnt/home
# │                                                       /mnt
# └─sdX3
#   crypto_LUKS 2
#   └─cryptswap
#     swap                                                [SWAP]
```

**SUCCESS:** Verify:
- /mnt - mounted (@ subvolume)
- /mnt/home - mounted (@home subvolume)
- /mnt/var/log - mounted (@log subvolume)
- /mnt/var/cache - mounted (@cache subvolume)
- /mnt/.snapshots - mounted (@snapshots subvolume)
- /mnt/boot - mounted (EFI partition)
- SWAP - active (cryptswap)

**SUCCESS:** Phase 2 Complete: Btrfs filesystem with 5 subvolumes + swap active

**NEXT:** Next: Install base Arch Linux system (Phase 2)

---

## Phase 2: Base System Installation

**TIME:** Estimated Time: 15-30 minutes (depends on internet speed)  
**NEXT:** Restart Count: 0

**Download Size: ~800 MB - 1.2 GB**

### Step 2.1: Update Pacman Mirror List (for faster downloads)

```bash
# Backup original mirrorlist
cp /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist.backup

# Sort mirrors by speed using reflector
reflector --country US,Germany,France \
  --age 12 \
  --protocol https \
  --sort rate \
  --save /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
```

**Wait 10-20 seconds** for reflector to test mirrors.

**Verify mirrorlist:**
```bash
# Show top 5 fastest mirrors
head -10 /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
```

### Step 2.2: Install Base System and Essential Packages

**SUCCESS:** Base system installation complete

### Step 2.3: Verify Installation

```bash
# Check that critical files were installed
ls /mnt/bin /mnt/etc /mnt/usr

# Should show directories with files
```

**SUCCESS:** Phase 2 Complete: Base Arch Linux system installed to /mnt

**NEXT:** Next: Configure system (timezone, locale, hostname) in chroot (Phase 2)

---

## Phase 2: System Configuration (Chroot)

**TIME:** Estimated Time: 10-15 minutes  
**NEXT:** Restart Count: 0

**What is chroot?**
- Change root into the new system
- Allows configuration as if you're booted into the installed system
- All following commands run inside the new Arch installation

### Step 2.1: Generate Fstab (Filesystem Table)

```bash
# Generate /etc/fstab based on current mounts (UUID-based)
# Note: This command appends to /mnt/etc/fstab - if file exists, it will be overwritten
genfstab -U /mnt > /mnt/etc/fstab
```

**Verify fstab was created:**
```bash
cat /mnt/etc/fstab

# Should show (UUIDs will differ):
# UUID=XXXX-XXXX  /boot  vfat  defaults  0  2
# UUID=YYYY...    /      btrfs subvol=@,compress=zstd,noatime  0  0
# UUID=YYYY...    /home  btrfs subvol=@home,compress=zstd,noatime  0  0
# UUID=YYYY...    /var/log  btrfs subvol=@log,compress=zstd,noatime  0  0
# UUID=YYYY...    /var/cache  btrfs subvol=@cache,compress=zstd,noatime  0  0
# UUID=YYYY...    /.snapshots  btrfs subvol=@snapshots,compress=zstd,noatime  0  0
# UUID=ZZZZ...    none   swap  defaults  0  0
```

**SUCCESS:** Fstab generated successfully

### Step 2.2: Chroot into New System

```bash
# Change root into the new Arch installation
arch-chroot /mnt
```

**Prompt changes to:**
```
[root@archiso /]#
```

**SUCCESS:** You are now INSIDE the new Arch system

**WARNING:** ALL REMAINING COMMANDS RUN INSIDE CHROOT (until we exit later)

### Step 2.3: Set Timezone

```bash
# Set timezone (replace with your timezone)
# Examples:
#   Europe/London
#   America/New_York
#   Asia/Tokyo
ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/London /etc/localtime

# Generate /etc/adjtime
hwclock --systohc
```

**Verify timezone:**
```bash
timedatectl status

# Should show:
# Time zone: Europe/London (GMT, +0000)
```

### Step 2.4: Set Locale (Language and Character Encoding)

```bash
# Uncomment en_US.UTF-8 in locale.gen
sed -i 's/#en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8/' /etc/locale.gen

# Generate locales
locale-gen

# Should show:
# Generating locales...
#   en_US.UTF-8... done
# Generation complete.
```

**Set system locale:**
```bash
# Create locale.conf
echo "LANG=en_US.UTF-8" > /etc/locale.conf
```

**Verify locale:**
```bash
cat /etc/locale.conf

# Should show:
# LANG=en_US.UTF-8
```

### Step 2.5: Set Hostname

```bash
# Set hostname (replace "archlinux" with your desired hostname)
echo "archlinux" > /etc/hostname
```

**Configure hosts file:**
```bash
# Create /etc/hosts
cat > /etc/hosts << EOF
127.0.0.1   localhost
::1         localhost
127.0.1.1   archlinux.localdomain archlinux
EOF
```

**Verify hosts file:**
```bash
cat /etc/hosts

# Should show:
# 127.0.0.1   localhost
# ::1         localhost
# 127.0.1.1   archlinux.localdomain archlinux
```

### Step 2.6: Set Root Password

```bash
# Set root password
passwd
```

**Prompt:**
```
New password:
```

**Enter strong root password** (this is for system recovery, not daily use)

**Retype password** to confirm.

**SUCCESS:** Root password set

### Step 2.7: Configure Pacman (Enable Multilib and Parallel Downloads)

```bash
# Edit /etc/pacman.conf
nano /etc/pacman.conf
```

**Find and uncomment these lines:**

```ini
# Misc options
#UseSyslog
Color
#NoProgressBar
#CheckSpace
#VerbosePkgLists
ParallelDownloads = 5

# Enable multilib repository (for 32-bit support)
[multilib]
Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
```

**Changes to make:**
1. Uncomment `Color` (already shown above)
2. Uncomment `ParallelDownloads = 5`
3. Uncomment `[multilib]` section (both lines)

**Save and exit** (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X)

**Update package database:**
```bash
pacman -Sy
```

**SUCCESS:** Phase 2 Complete: System configured (timezone, locale, hostname, root password)

**NEXT:** Next: Install and configure GRUB bootloader (Phase 2)

---

## Phase 2: Bootloader Installation (GRUB)

**TIME:** Estimated Time: 5-10 minutes  
**NEXT:** Restart Count: 0

**[GRUB](https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/)** (GRand Unified Bootloader):
- Manages boot menu
- Handles LUKS decryption parameters
- Displays boot options with 5-second timeout
- **Official Resources:**
  - [GNU GRUB Website](https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/)
  - [ArchWiki GRUB](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GRUB)
  - [GRUB Manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/)

### Step 2.1: Install GRUB to EFI Partition

```bash
# Install GRUB bootloader to EFI partition
grub-install --target=x86_64-efi \
  --efi-directory=/boot \
  --bootloader-id=GRUB \
  --recheck

# --target=x86_64-efi: UEFI 64-bit mode
# --efi-directory=/boot: Mount point of EFI partition
# --bootloader-id=GRUB: Boot entry name in UEFI
# --recheck: Force device map regeneration
```

**Output:**
```
Installing for x86_64-efi platform.
Installation finished. No error reported.
```

**SUCCESS:** GRUB installed to EFI partition

### Step 2.2: Get UUID of Encrypted Root Partition

**What is UUID?**
UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) is a permanent identifier for disk partitions. GRUB needs the UUID to locate the encrypted partition during boot.

```bash
# Display ALL partition UUIDs
blkid

# Display only encrypted root partition UUID
# Replace /dev/sdX2 with your actual root partition
blkid /dev/sdX2

# Alternative: Filter only UUID value
blkid -s UUID -o value /dev/sdX2
```

**Expected output:**
```
/dev/sdX2: UUID="a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890" TYPE="crypto_LUKS" PARTUUID="..."
```

**Steps to copy UUID:**
1. Run: `blkid /dev/sdX2`
2. Look for `UUID="..."` in the output
3. Copy the value between quotes (format: `XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX`)
4. Example: `a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890`

**WARNING:** You will need this UUID in the next step (Step 8.3)

**Tip:** Write down the UUID or keep this terminal window open for reference.

### Step 2.3: Configure GRUB for LUKS Encryption

```bash
# Edit /etc/default/grub
nano /etc/default/grub
```

**Find and modify the following lines:**

**Line 1: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT**

Find:
```bash
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="loglevel=3 quiet"
```

Change to:
```bash
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="loglevel=3 quiet"
```

**Line 2: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX**

Find:
```bash
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=""
```

Change to (**WARNING:** REPLACE `<YOUR_UUID>` WITH YOUR ACTUAL UUID):
```bash
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cryptdevice=UUID=<YOUR_UUID>:cryptroot root=/dev/mapper/cryptroot rootflags=subvol=@"
```

**Line 3: GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER**

Find:
```bash
#GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=false
```

Uncomment (remove #) if you want to detect Windows:
```bash
GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=false
```

**Parameter Explanation:**
- `cryptdevice=UUID=...:cryptroot` - Decrypt LUKS partition and name it "cryptroot"
- `root=/dev/mapper/cryptroot` - Use decrypted device as root
- `rootflags=subvol=@` - Mount Btrfs @ subvolume as root
- `GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=false` - Allow detection of Windows (if dual-booting)

**Save and exit** (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X)

### Step 2.4: Generate GRUB Configuration

```bash
# Generate GRUB config file
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

**Expected output:**
```
Generating grub configuration file ...
Found linux image: /boot/vmlinuz-linux
Found initrd image: /boot/initramfs-linux.img
Found fallback initrd image: /boot/initramfs-linux-fallback.img
done
```

**If Windows is detected (dual-boot):**
```
Warning: os-prober will be executed to detect other bootable partitions.
Found Windows Boot Manager on /dev/sdX1@/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi
Adding boot menu entry for UEFI Firmware Settings ...
done
```

**SUCCESS:** Phase 2 Complete: GRUB bootloader installed and configured

**NEXT:** Next: Setup automatic LUKS decryption with keyfile (Phase 2, optional)

---

## Phase 2: Automatic LUKS Decryption Setup (Optional)

**TIME:** Estimated Time: 10-15 minutes  
**NEXT:** Restart Count: 0

**What This Does:**
- Creates a keyfile for LUKS decryption
- Embeds keyfile in initramfs (boot image)
- Configures boot to auto-decrypt without password prompt
- Maintains full encryption security (data encrypted at rest)

**Security Note:**
- Keyfile is in `/boot` (unencrypted partition)
- Physical access to `/boot` allows decryption
- Acceptable for personal systems under your control
- If higher security needed, keep password prompt enabled

### Step 2.1: Create Keyfile Directory

```bash
# Create directory for LUKS keyfile
mkdir -p /etc/cryptsetup.d

# Set strict permissions (root-only access)
chmod 700 /etc/cryptsetup.d
```

### Step 2.2: Generate LUKS Keyfile

```bash
# Generate 512-byte random keyfile
dd if=/dev/urandom of=/etc/cryptsetup.d/root.key bs=512 count=1

# Output:
# 1+0 records in
# 1+0 records out
# 512 bytes copied, 0.000... s, ... MB/s
```

**Set strict permissions:**
```bash
# Only root can read/write this file
chmod 600 /etc/cryptsetup.d/root.key
```

**Verify permissions:**
```bash
ls -la /etc/cryptsetup.d/root.key

# Should show:
# -rw------- 1 root root 512 Dec  1 15:30 /etc/cryptsetup.d/root.key
```

### Step 2.3: Add Keyfile to LUKS Key Slot

```bash
# Add keyfile to LUKS key slot 1 (slot 0 has your passphrase)
# Replace /dev/sdX2 with your actual root partition
cryptsetup luksAddKey /dev/sdX2 /etc/cryptsetup.d/root.key
```

**Prompt:**
```
Enter any existing passphrase:
```

**Enter the LUKS passphrase** you created earlier during encryption.

**Should show:** (no output = success)

**Verify keyfile was added:**
```bash
cryptsetup luksDump /dev/sdX2 | grep "Key Slot"

# Should show:
# Key Slot 0: ENABLED
# Key Slot 1: ENABLED
# Key Slot 2: DISABLED
# ...
```

**SUCCESS:** Keyfile added to LUKS

### Step 2.4: Add Keyfile to Swap Partition (Same Process)

```bash
# Add keyfile to encrypted swap partition
# Replace /dev/sdX3 with your actual swap partition
cryptsetup luksAddKey /dev/sdX3 /etc/cryptsetup.d/root.key

# Enter existing passphrase: (same as before)
```

### Step 2.5: Configure Initramfs to Include Keyfile

```bash
# Edit /etc/mkinitcpio.conf
nano /etc/mkinitcpio.conf
```

**Find and modify these lines:**

**Line 1: FILES**

Find:
```bash
FILES=()
```

Change to:
```bash
FILES=(/etc/cryptsetup.d/root.key)
```

**This embeds the keyfile into initramfs**

**Line 2: HOOKS**

Find:
```bash
HOOKS=(base udev autodetect modconf block filesystems keyboard fsck)
```

Change to:
```bash
HOOKS=(base udev autodetect modconf block encrypt filesystems keyboard fsck)
```

**Added:** `encrypt` hook (handles LUKS decryption at boot)

**WARNING:** CRITICAL: Order matters:
- `block` MUST come BEFORE `encrypt`
- `encrypt` MUST come BEFORE `filesystems`
- `keyboard` should come AFTER `filesystems`

**Save and exit** (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X)

### Step 2.6: Update GRUB for Keyfile

```bash
# Edit /etc/default/grub again
nano /etc/default/grub
```

**Find line starting with `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=`**

Change from:
```bash
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cryptdevice=UUID=<YOUR_UUID>:cryptroot root=/dev/mapper/cryptroot rootflags=subvol=@"
```

To (add `cryptkey` parameter at the beginning):
```bash
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cryptkey=rootfs:/etc/cryptsetup.d/root.key cryptdevice=UUID=<YOUR_UUID>:cryptroot root=/dev/mapper/cryptroot rootflags=subvol=@"
```

**WARNING:** REPLACE UUID with your actual UUID from blkid

**Parameter added:** `cryptkey=rootfs:/etc/cryptsetup.d/root.key`

**Save and exit** (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X)

### Step 2.7: Configure Encrypted Swap Auto-Unlock

```bash
# Create /etc/crypttab for swap
cat > /etc/crypttab << EOF
# <name>       <device>                             <keyfile>                          <options>
cryptswap      /dev/sdX3                            /etc/cryptsetup.d/root.key         luks
EOF
```

**Replace `/dev/sdX3` with your actual swap partition**

**Verify crypttab:**
```bash
cat /etc/crypttab

# Should show:
# cryptswap /dev/sdX3 /etc/cryptsetup.d/root.key luks
```

**Update fstab for encrypted swap:**
```bash
# Edit /etc/fstab
nano /etc/fstab
```

**Find the swap line** (looks like):
```
UUID=ZZZZ-ZZZZ-ZZZZ  none  swap  defaults  0  0
```

**Change to:**
```
/dev/mapper/cryptswap  none  swap  defaults  0  0
```

**Save and exit** (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X)

### Step 2.8: Rebuild Initramfs and GRUB

```bash
# Regenerate initramfs (includes keyfile now)
mkinitcpio -P

# Should show:
# ==> Building image from preset: /etc/mkinitcpio.d/linux.preset: 'default'
#   -> -k /boot/vmlinuz-linux -c /etc/mkinitcpio.conf -g /boot/initramfs-linux.img
# ==> Starting build: '6.x.x-arch1-1'
# ...
# ==> Image generation successful
# ==> Building image from preset: /etc/mkinitcpio.d/linux.preset: 'fallback'
# ...
# ==> Image generation successful
```

**Regenerate GRUB config:**
```bash
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

### Step 2.9: Verify Keyfile is in Initramfs

```bash
# List contents of initramfs
lsinitcpio /boot/initramfs-linux.img | grep root.key

# Should show:
# etc/cryptsetup.d/root.key
```

**SUCCESS:** Keyfile is embedded in initramfs

**SUCCESS:** Phase 2 Complete: Automatic LUKS decryption configured

**Note:** You can toggle this on/off anytime by modifying `/etc/mkinitcpio.conf` and rebuilding initramfs.
